# VoronMods
modifications to Voron v2 printer

Added new re-circulating filter to rear exhaust location. Based on V2.2 exhaust housing, V2.4 rear exhaust housing, and u/0ndsk4's Nevermore micro re-circulating filter.

Uses 2 5015 Blower fans, and 4mm activated carbon pellets. The filter basket can be slightly larger since it is not restricted to fitting underneath the bed,
however I did have to add two holes to the back panel for the blower inlet.

4x heatset inserts
4x m3 screws (6-8mm length OK)
2x 5015 blower fans (confirmed fitment with Winsin brand, but same as used in nevermore micro)
4x 6x3mm magnets (same as used in V2 BOM)

Approx 200g of 4mm activated carbon pellets, I bought mine here:
